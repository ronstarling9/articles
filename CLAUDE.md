# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a content repository for articles and thought leadership pieces. It contains markdown files for drafting, researching, and publishing professional articles.

## Content Structure

Each article lives in its own topic folder:
```
topic-name/
├── brainstorm.md   # Research notes, source citations, strategic choices, draft iterations
└── article.md      # Final or near-final version ready for publication
```

The root `README.md` serves as an index linking to published pieces.

## Writing Guidelines

When helping with articles in this repository:

1. **Preserve author voice** - Articles are written by Ron Starling with a specific professional tone (senior consultant, technology transformation focus)
2. **Maintain research rigor** - Brainstorm files contain source citations; keep these intact and add new sources when relevant
3. **Target platforms matter** - Check the brainstorm file for target platform (e.g., LinkedIn) and word count constraints
4. **Contrarian framing** - Current articles use deliberately contrarian positioning; maintain this approach unless directed otherwise

##Workflow
1. First, think through the problem. Read recommended and supporting research before writing a plan in a todo.md in the article working directory.
2. The plan should be a checklist of todo items.
3. Check in with me before starting work. I will verify the plan.
4. Then complete the todos one by one; mark them off as you go.
5. At every step give me a high level explanation of what you changed.
6. Keep every change simple and minimal.
7. At the end use the writing-clearly-and-concisely skill to review for clarity and proper style.
